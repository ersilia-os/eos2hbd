# Passive-permeability

Passive permeability based on simulations

| Description | Input  | Output  | Training Data | Experimental Validation |
| ------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Passive permeability prediction of drug membranes that rely on a physics-based coarse-grained model that reduces the size of chemical space to make exploration of the space easier.  | SMILES | P | 511,427 molecules | Yes |

**Note: P is the permeability coefficient**
